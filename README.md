📘 EducationAdvisor
EducationAdvisor is a student-focused web application designed to guide learners in choosing the right education paths, courses, and career options.  
The platform provides structured educational information through a clean and responsive user interface.
🧠 How It Works
- The application is built using **React** for the frontend.
- Users interact with the UI to explore educational guidance and resources.
- The frontend can communicate with backend APIs (located in the `backend` folder) to fetch or manage data.
- Backend services can be connected to a database to store and retrieve educational or user-related information.
APIs & Database
- Backend APIs handle data requests and business logic.
- The project structure supports integration with databases such as **MySQL** or **MongoDB** (depending on backend implementation).
- Currently, the frontend is ready to consume API data when backend endpoints are available.
